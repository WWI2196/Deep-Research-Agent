      "- **Avoid assumptions**:  \n",
      "  - If a metric (e.g., \"humidity trends\") is not in primary sources, state: \"No data available for this metric in current sources.\"  \n",
      "  - Never extrapolate data (e.g., \"snowfall in Paris\" if Paris is outside the defined scope).  \n",
      "- **Verify consistency**:  \n",
      "  - Cross-check Météo-France data with EEA or WMO. If discrepancies exist, note them (e.g., \"Météo-France reports X mm rainfall; EEA reports Y mm; this may reflect different station networks\").  \n",
      "- **Use first-person instructions**:  \n",
      "  - Example: \"I will extract monthly temperature data from Météo-France’s official dataset for Lille and Calais, then compare them in a table.\"  \n",
      "- **Preserve language**:  \n",
      "  - All output must be in English (user’s input language).  \n",
      "- **No creative interpretation**:  \n",
      "  - If a source says \"temperatures are mild,\" cite the exact data (e.g., \"average winter high: 7°C\") instead of subjective phrasing.  \n",
